Minesweeper implementation as practice for Triplebyte interview.

# The game

Minesweeper is a single player  hidden information game that takes place on a 2d board.

Each space contains a mine or is empty.

The players activates tiles one at a time. If the activated tiles contains a mine the player loses. The player wins when all non-mine tiles are activated.

An activated empty tile displays the number of vertically, horizontally, or diagonally adjacent tiles around it that contain mines. The player should use this information to infer which tiels do not contain mines and activate them.
